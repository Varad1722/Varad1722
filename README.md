### 🚀 About Me  

Robotics enthusiast and automation engineer with industry and research experience in building multirobot systems, autonomous drones, machine vision pipelines, and factory automation. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Robotics & Autonomous Systems at Arizona State University with a focus on real-world robot deployment and intelligent control.

- 🚁 **Drone Vision & Soft Landing:** Developed systems for drones to autonomously follow and land on moving targets using image processing in Simulink.
- 🌱 **Weed-Crop Detection:** Trained YOLOv4 on custom datasets for real-time agricultural analysis via Jetson-based rover.
- 🚀 **Mars Terrain Exploration:** Simulated collaboration between aerial scout drone and ground rover for extraterrestrial exploration using ROS2 + MAVLink.
- 🧠 **Gaussian Splatting + Photogrammetry:** Enhanced 3D reconstruction from Apollo 17 datasets by generating novel camera views using neural techniques.
- 🛠️ **Process Automation:** Designed, deployed, and tested industrial robots, HMI systems, and AI-driven QC pipelines in real manufacturing environments.
